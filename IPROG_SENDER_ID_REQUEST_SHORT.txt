Subject: Custom Sender ID Approval Request - STOCKWISE

Hello iProg Support Team,

I am a student working on my capstone project, and I would like to request approval for a custom sender ID for my account.

This is for an academic capstone project - an inventory management system with SMS notifications.

Account Details:
- API Token: ca42e08b40ba51019938dca6599f28b5a9605acd
- Phone: +639630675254

Sender ID Request:
- Requested Name: STOCKWISE
- Project: StockWise Inventory Management System (Capstone Project)
- Purpose: Academic project - automated business notifications (sales reports, inventory alerts)
- Project Type: Educational/Academic demonstration

Use Case:
- Daily sales summaries (for project demonstration)
- Low stock alerts
- AI-powered pricing recommendations
- Estimated volume: 3-10 messages per day
- All transactional messages only
- Limited to capstone project testing and demonstration

As a student, I've already configured the sender ID in my system and it's ready to use once approved. This will complete the SMS notification feature of my capstone project.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or documentation.

Thank you!

Best regards,
StockWise Team
