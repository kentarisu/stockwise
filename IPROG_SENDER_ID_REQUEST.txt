Dear iProg Support Team,

I am a student working on my capstone project, and I am writing to request the registration and approval of a custom Sender ID for my iProg SMS API account.

This is for an academic capstone project - a fully functional inventory management system with SMS notification capabilities. The system is being developed as part of my final year project and will demonstrate real-world business application integration.

ACCOUNT DETAILS:

PURPOSE & USE CASE:
The custom sender ID "STOCKWISE" will be used for sending automated business notifications to our admin users, including:

1. Daily Sales Summary Reports
   - Sent daily at 8:00 PM
   - Contains revenue, transaction count, and top-selling products
   
2. Low Stock Alerts
   - Real-time notifications when inventory falls below threshold
   - Helps prevent stockouts
   
3. AI-Powered Pricing Recommendations
   - Demand-driven pricing suggestions
   - Sent every 3 days based on sales reports

MESSAGE RECIPIENTS:

- No marketing or promotional messages

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Integration: Python Django application
- API Endpoint: https://sms.iprogtech.com/api/v1/sms_messages
- Implementation Status: Already configured and tested
- Currently shows: "IPROGSMS" (awaiting approval for "STOCKWISE")

EXPECTED VOLUME:
- Estimated daily messages: 3-10 SMS
- Peak volume: 15-20 SMS per day
- All messages are transactional/informational

BENEFITS OF APPROVAL:
1. Professional branding for our business communications
2. Improved recipient recognition and trust
3. Better customer experience
4. Clear identification of business notifications

COMPLIANCE:
- All messages comply with Philippine SMS regulations
- Recipients have opted-in to receive notifications
- Only transactional messages (no spam or marketing)
- This is an academic capstone project for educational purposes
- System demonstrates professional-grade implementation
- Limited to project demonstration and testing

REQUEST:
Please approve and activate the sender ID "STOCKWISE" for my account so that all SMS sent via my API token will display "STOCKWISE" instead of "IPROGSMS".

I am available to provide any additional information or documentation required for this approval.
